# ESP-Mesh Network
This is my Mesh network for an early warning system which will be triigerd
via the main parent node by the use of a button. 
This siganl is then transmitted via the mesh to all the other nodes 
with a theroretical infinate distance. This data will then tigger the 
lighs and buzzer indicating the system is in use. 

# Old and New.
This is more being used as a  back up place where I can upload my files more easily.
THIS IS IN NO MEANS THE FINALL project.
